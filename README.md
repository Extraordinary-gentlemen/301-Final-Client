# Pump Finder

**Authors**: Dustin Mundy, Joe Waine, Adrian Hawk, Robert Reed
**Version**: 1.30.2

## Overview
The goal of our app is to use the user's location (or a location they supply), the user's vehicle information (mpg), and the amount of gas the user wants to purchase to determine which gas station will provide them with the cheapest overall cost, when travel costs are accounted for.

## Getting Started
To use this app live, simply go to https://pumpfinder.herokuapp.com/ or http://pumpfinder.us.

To run our app locally, fork and clone our server (https://github.com/Extraordinary-gentlemen/pumpfinder-server.git) and client (https://github.com/Extraordinary-gentlemen/pumpfinder-client.git) repositories, then `cd` into those directories and (assuming you have `npm` installed) run `npm init` from the terminal in each directory. Set your `env` variables as indicated below, then launch each server with `nodemon` (or `npm start`).
